### What is a burn-down chart?

shows progress
Rate of completed work.
Y-axis: shows work to be completed in storypoints or hours
X-axis: shows time span planned for work to be completed: sprint, release, projects

Asumes that 

![](../burnDown.jpg)

Blue dotted line reprsents planned work to be completed (with an ideal distribuition) the red one, the actual remaining work.

When the red line moves above the blue one, it means that the task took more time to be completed than what we estimeated PROGRESS IS SLOWER THAN PLANNED


### Burn-up chart
![](../burnUp.jpg)
Start considering that at the beggining of the sprint you haven't "earn" points completed and as the sprint progresses, and stories are being closed, the team "earns" points

relationship inverst to the burndown

A burn-up chart makes it easy to see changes in the scope(more storypoints/hours than expected) those are shown in the blue dotted line, so the team at the end met the originally expected but no the changes

As in the image, the team was behind (red line separated down from the planned) and there were chanfes 


IDEA: BURN-UP CHART FOR TOSCA UPGRADE
